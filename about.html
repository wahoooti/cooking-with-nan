                <h2>I may be biased, but in my eyes, nothing quite beats my Nan’s cooking</h2>

                <p>As a child when we would go away on family holidays, I was always the first to wake up and tap on
                    Nan and Pop’s caravan door. I would climb into their bed and over the next hour my cousins would
                    pile in, one by one until there was no more room for Nan, which is when she would get up and start
                    cooking us kids breakfast. </p>
                <p>The smell of bacon would fill the caravan with such intensity. There was
                    something about the way she cooked it that made it taste so much better than any one else. As
                    first in, I got first serve, where Nan would layer rash upon rash on my plate, I was in heaven.</p>

                <h2>Wednesday’s at Nan & Pops</h2>

                <p>School Holidays meant a trip to Nan and Pop’s each Wednesday. We would all sit together on the
                    back patio eating tomato, onion and vinegar rolls, followed by some sort of special treat
                    Nan would have tucked away for me.</p>
                    <p>I would usually go down to her garden, rip all the petals off her flowers and mix them together
                    with water and bake like Nan would. Or she would sit me down at her back table to make biscuits,
                    most often than not I would have eaten all the dough by the time they were meant to go into the
                    oven.</p>
                    <p>Memories like this filled my childhood and followed me into my adult hood. I have always been a lover 
                    of food, and Nan’s cooking fed it.</p>

                <h2>Then came the idea...</h2>

                <p>One lazy Sunday afternoon in late 2010 my Nan mentioned she may need help with the christmas
                    pudding as she thought last year it was too heavy to lift out from the stove. Christmas wouldn’t be
                    Christmas without her Christmas Pud, so a couple weeks later I drove over and had my
                    first cooking lesson.</p>
                <p>It was then I found out that all these recipes weren’t written down. All those memories, the trips down the farm with the Apple Pie, sneaking a bit of
                    Chocolate Slice while no ones looking, they would all become a memory. So I
                    decided to become Nan’s apprentice.</p>

                <h2>And so it began</h2>

                <body>From then on, every couple of months I would drive over to Nan’s. We would eat lunch together on
                    the back patio and get stuck into the baking. 
                    Some days the baking would turn out exactly how I remembered, and other days we would be too busy
                    talking that we would forget something. One day we forgot the eggs in the cake and Nan gave me
                    permission to go home and eat the whole cake for dinner as it would be rock hard the next day.
                    This, I had no problem doing.</body>

                        <h2>A year of Wedding Cakes</h2>
        
                        <p>When we started planning the wedding we wanted our families recipes to be part of that with my Nan’s fruit cake, now known as the Wedding Cake, to be the main event.
                                <p>The year leading up to the wedding we made Wedding Cake after Wedding Cake. Adding more nuts, more rum, more everything. Its safe to say I now know how to make this with my eyes closed. </p>
                                To top it off, my mum finished the cake by icing it. Three generations baking together, all for our friends to enjoy on such a special occasion.</p>

                <h2>And now Nan's classic recipies are available to be enjoyed</h2>

                <p>As Nan cooks by eye we have tried to measure the ingredients as best we can, but you may find you will need to do some experimenting.
                        You may also find some recipes make twice the amount of cake as you need. This is because when Nan bakes she has all her kids and grand kids in mind. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately there’s a few recipes that had been forgotten by the time we went to make them, but we hope you enjoy the recipes we did make as much as I do, and that they too become your regular go-to recipes.</p>
